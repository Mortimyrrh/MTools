# MTools for Live v1.9

![MTools](assets/device_screenshot.png)

MTools for Live (MT4L) is a suite of ambisonic Max for Live devices created during my Masters. The tools enable the encoding and processing of 5th order ambisonic signals in Ableton Live. The tools focuses on enabling rapid interaction with spatialisation with an emphasis on creativity, not utility.


Date Released: 13/9/20


Three things to note. 

1) Please install all the dependencies below and place the MTools Folder into your Ableton User library or it won't work.

2) The suite has not been tested on any operating system other than MacOS but should work.

3) The spiral decoder has not been tested due to Covid19 studio restrictions.
